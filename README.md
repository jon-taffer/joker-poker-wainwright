# joker poker: meet & beat the biggest joke within casino industry
![](david.png)

i got no clue on how to calculate rtp cause i'm being bullied by a 60 year old man from warren farm in u.k. (m8 of ralph hamers/martijn van horssen/credit suisse)

please note best prolly is to make real solitaire experience, by making on win option to bet again, so it drags on or actual makes u 'hold' games

**make incremental stages so win (and loss) is endless**

#### game speed
needs be fast asf, probably also hotkey instead of dragging card to acetraps/holders or even key pressed on offline videopoker
