# joker poker: meet & beat the biggest joke within casino industry
![](david.png)

i got no clue on how to calculate rtp cause i'm being bullied by a 60 year old man from warren farm in u.k. 

though important to note that in similar way you can embed 'slot' mechanic within the rather bland (and boring) video poker, as the joker mechanic should be a slot-esque payout (meaning not predefined in hard rules like video poker itself)

the idea was born few hours ago i got nobody to make it together with or for so whatever but aslong base game is profitable (and it should be, because u are basically making it so people are holding whole games opposed to 3 cards & re-betting the win+initial bet by making incremental joker games, whilst adding an bonus adjecative to the game that should maybe interest younger crowds to start playing video poker more also)

please note best prolly is to make real solitaire experience, by making on win option to bet again, so it drags on or actual makes u 'hold' games

**make incremental stages so win (and loss) is endless**

#### game speed
needs be fast asf, probably also hotkey instead of dragging card to acetraps/holders or even key pressed on offline videopoker

#### __VERY IMPORTANT THIS IS ONLY PRE BONUS GAME, BUT IDEAS ARE ENDLESS, BUT IN MY OPINION SHOULD MAKE IT AS CLOSE TO SOLITAIRE, THAT MEANS "CONTINUE" BETS (gamble/risk) AND THEN TO ACTUALLY HOLD YOUR WHOLE CURRENT WINS INSTEAD OF INDIVIDUAL CARDS HOLDING/SHOE'ING__
